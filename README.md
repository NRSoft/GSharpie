# GSharpie
GRBL-compatible software for executing G# (extended G-code) programs on CNC

G# is a macro-programming language for CNC control which extends traditional G-code programming
by allowing to use variables, conditions, loop executions and subroutine calls.
The G# program can contain both plain G-code lines as well as the extended commands.
G# syntax is a subset of [LinuxCNC](https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc) and
[RS274/NGC](https://www.nist.gov/customcf/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=823374).
